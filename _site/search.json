    "text": "Context\nWith the global commercialization of soccer, clubs have been significantly spending more on their squads. Takeovers from American investors and controversy concerning foreign investment has sparked topics about teams’ sources of wealth. Across many sports, there have been discussions about the implementation of salary caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe data was collected from fbref; since payrolls and standings were stored in different locations and separated by years, the data was compiled into a single excel file. Data includes the top five European leagues from mainly the 2013 to 2022 seasons. I estimated a Bayesian linear model with standing as the dependent variable and payroll rank as the independent variable."

The website is well-suited to observe transfers and historical results across many leagues and years.\n\n\nProcess\nSince data was broken up by season and year with standing separated from annual wages, I had to mannualy create an excel file to consolidate the data. This took a few hours of copy and pasting, but made the analysis part much easier. In total, there are 1052 data points in the final file.\n\n\n\nScreen Shot of FBREF Salaries page\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen Shot of Top5Leagues_Payroll.xlsx"

    "text": "General\nAcross the data set, we can a positive correlation between payroll rank and standings. Lookly closely there are notable examples like Leicester City’s 15/16 EPL title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere it matters\nIn European soccer competition, the top four and bottom three standings are important. For the top leagues, a top four place secures Champions League qualification, the most prestigious club soccer tournament; a bottom three place means relegation (demotion to the second division).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich teams are spending wisely?\nTo categorize how teams are performing relative to their the payroll rank, I took the difference of standing and payroll rank each year as a measurement. A positive differece means that a team over performed that specific year. The total column represents the sum of the difference in all the years the team appeared in the data set, and rate is the average difference."
