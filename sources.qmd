### Data
All data was compiled using the [fbref](https://fbref.com/en/) soccer database. Fbref is an extensive soccer database, and it is part of the bigger sports data collection by Sports Reference. The website is well-suited to observe transfers and historical results across many leagues and years.   

 
### Process
Since data was broken up by season and year with standing separated from annual wages, I had to mannualy create an excel file to consolidate the data. This took a few hours of copy and pasting, but made the analysis part much easier. In total, there are 1052 data points in the final file.
